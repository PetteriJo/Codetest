Bitcoin program is very easy to use. First you decide if you want to run the program or not (0 or 1).
If you choose to run the program, then you have to give two dates: first the starting date and second the ending date (yyyy.mm.dd).
After you give dates the program should run smoothly and give you all the information you need.
